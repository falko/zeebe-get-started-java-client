## Run with Maven

Build the JAR file with Maven

```

Then start the broker:

```
docker-compose up -d broker
```

And execute it with Java

```
java -jar target/zeebe-get-started-java-client-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

After executing, please remember to shutdown the broker:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

## docker-compose

Make sure to build the worker by running `mvn clean package`.

Then start the broker:

```
docker-compose up -d broker
```

and start the worker
